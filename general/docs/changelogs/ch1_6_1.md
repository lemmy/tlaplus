### Additional noteworthy changes

#### TLC
* Annotation-based loading of TLC module overrides for TLA+ operators. eb42f9ed462782c1577ec7433a993b770959437e

#### Toolbox

##### Preferences
* The "Show Evaluate Constant Expression in its own tab" preference has been moved from `TLA+ Preferences → TLC Model Checker` to `TLA+ Preferences → Model Editor`

##### Model Editor
* The style of the display of definitions in the "Definition Override" section in the Spec Options tab can be defined in the `TLA+ Preferences → Model Editor` preferences. There are two styles currently; given a `Definition` from a `Module Name` referenced in the primary spec like `InstanceName == INSTANCE ModuleName WITH ...`, then the two available styles are:
 * `Definition [Module Name]`
 * `InstanceName!Definition`

##### Trace Explorer
* The Error-Trace can now be filtered to omit one or more variables and/or expressions. Clicking on the filter icon, when filtering is not on, will display a dialog allowing the user to select from the set of variables and expressions found in the trace; alternatively, the user may ALT-click on a variable or expression in the Error-Trace tree view which will then omit that variable or expression. A screencast of this [can be seen here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/error-trace-filtering.gif)
* [Allow Trace-Explorer to extend additional TLA+ modules](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/342)  

### A note to macOS users
Startup on macOS version 10.14 (Mojave) will fail with "TLA+ Toolbox can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.".  Please make sure to follow the instructions outlined in [GitHub issue #320](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/320) to address this problem.
