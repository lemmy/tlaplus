### Additional noteworthy changes

#### TLC
* Annotation-based loading of TLC module overrides for TLA+ operators. eb42f9ed462782c1577ec7433a993b770959437e

#### Toolbox

##### Preferences
* The "Show Evaluate Constant Expression in its own tab" preference has been moved from `TLA+ Preferences → TLC Model Checker` to `TLA+ Preferences → Model Editor`
* The `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS` preference subtree has been altered:
 * the previous page at `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS` is now at `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Color Predicates`.
 * The page previously at `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Additional Preferences` is now renamed to `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Other Preferences`.
 * Non-color-predicate-related preferences from `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS → Additional Preferences` have been moved into `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS`.
 * `TLA+ Preferences → TLAPS` now also features the ability to set a file system location for the `tlapm` executable should the Toolbox not be able to find it.

##### Spec Editor
* The spec editor now allows the collapsing of block comments, PlusCal code, and the TLA+ translation of PlusCal code. The first line of each of these types of runs should feature a minus icon in the line number gutter. Clicking on this icon will collapse the run; while in a collapsed state, holding the mouse over the, now: plus, icon will show the collapsed text as a tooltip.
 * Please review the help page for the PlusCal translator in the Toolbox for guidance
 as to how the comment block surround the PlusCal algorithm should be written.

##### Model Editor
* The style of the display of definitions in the "Definition Override" section in the Spec Options tab can be defined in the `TLA+ Preferences → Model Editor` preferences. There are two styles currently; given a `Definition` from a `Module Name` referenced in the primary spec like `InstanceName == INSTANCE ModuleName WITH ...`, then the two available styles are:
 * `Definition [Module Name]`
 * `InstanceName!Definition`
* The Initial predicate / Next-state text areas were no longer interpreting a TAB as 'advance focus.' They are again, now.

##### Spec Explorer
* Right-clicking on model snapshots was incorrectly presenting the choice to rename the snapshot; this has been corrected.
* Renaming specifications now correctly cleans up after itself [and should no longer prevent models from being opened.](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/339)

##### Trace Explorer
* The Error-Trace can now be filtered to omit one or more variables and/or expressions. Clicking on the filter icon, when filtering is not on, will display a dialog allowing the user to select from the set of variables and expressions found in the trace; alternatively, the user may ALT-click on a variable or expression in the Error-Trace tree view which will then omit that variable or expression. A screencast of this [can be seen here.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/error-trace-filtering.gif)
* [Allow Trace-Explorer to extend additional TLA+ modules](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/342) ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/ExtendModulesForTraceExplorer.gif))
* Export Error-Trace to system's clipboard ([Screencast](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/master/general/docs/changelogs/screencasts/ExportErrorTrace.gif))

### A note to macOS users
Startup on macOS version 10.14 (Mojave) will fail with "TLA+ Toolbox can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.".  Please make sure to follow the instructions outlined in [GitHub issue #320](https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/issues/320) to address this problem.
