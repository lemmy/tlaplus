You can help improve the TLA+ tools by choosing to allow TLC to collect execution statistics. This is optional â€” you must opt in to participate.
These statistics are [shared publicly](https://exec-stats.tlapl.us) and include details such as:

* Total number of cores and cores assigned to TLC
* Heap and off-heap memory allocated to TLC
* TLC version  (git commit SHA)
* If breadth-first search, depth-first search or simulation mode is active
* TLC implementation for the sets of seen and unseen states
* If TLC has been launched from an IDE
* Name, version, and architecture of the OS
* Vendor, version, and architecture of JVM
* The current date and time
* An installation ID which allows to group execution statistic (optionally)

Importantly, these statistics do not include any personal information. You can opt out at any time if you change your mind.
